## Instructions for Running the Code
This repository contains two primary components: **Data Processing** and **Modeling**.

Since all data files are stored in the team's Google Drive, the most efficient way to access these files is through `Google Colab`, utilizing its mount the drive function.

Given this setup, the instructions for running the Data Processing code and the Modeling code differ slightly.

### 1. Running the Data Processing Code:
#### Step1: Access Team's Google Drive
Please visit the link below to access team's Google Drive. This folder is public and anyone with the link wil be able to read the content.

#### Step2: Add Shortcut to your Drive
Add a shortcut to team's drive in order to see it in the Google Collab later.
