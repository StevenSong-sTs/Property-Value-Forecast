## Instructions for Running the Code
This repository contains two primary components: **Data Processing** and **Modeling**.

Since all data files are stored in the team's Google Drive, the most efficient way to access these files is through `Google Colab`, utilizing its mount the drive function.

Given this setup, the instructions for running the Data Processing code and the Modeling code differ slightly.

### 1. Running the Data Processing Code:
#### Step1: Access Team's Google Drive
Please visit the link below to access team's Google Drive. This folder is public and anyone with the link wil be able to read the content.

Link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yyb5Pu5pS4b7468yDXhn6lWfF0EHinlb?usp=sharing

#### Step2: Add Shortcut to your Drive
1. Add a shortcut to team's drive in order to see it in the Google Collab later.

2. In the pop up window, go to **All locations** tab, then click the 'Add' button to add shortcut to  'My Drive'

#### Step3: Validate Team's Drive Exist Under 'My Drive'
Click `My Drive`button on the left side bar, we should be able to see a shortcut to team23's drive has been added

#### Step4: Open Code in the Google Collab
Next, we are ready to run the code in the Google Collab. Go to the below link and signin with your Google account.

Then, select the `Github` in the pop up window and copy the link of this Github Repo to the input box

As we can see, all the files will appear in the scroll section below. Any code under the path: `src/Data_Processing` can be run here

#### Step5: Mount Drive to the Google Collab
Open `Chicago-CrimeData-Processing.ipynb` as an exmaple. 

1. Click the Folder Icon at the left side bar.

#### Step6: Run the Code
One the connection to G drive has been setup, the notebook are ready to run!

> **Note:** Running a different notebook might requires repeat this process. Please follow the same procedure to connect to the Google drive


### 2. Running the Modeling code:
#### Step1: Indentify the Operating System

#### Step2: Use the Correct `requirement.txt` to install all the packages

#### Step3: Run the Code
